# Port-Operations-KPI-Intelligence-Dashboard
A comprehensive KPI reporting and performance intelligence system developed for Transnet Port Terminals (2016-2018). This solution automated weekly operational reporting, standardised performance visualisation, and established an accountability framework for driving continuous improvement.

## Business Challenge

Weekly operational reporting required manual data compilation across multiple systems, with no standardised format for presenting performance metrics to stakeholders. This created several issues:

- Inefficient process: Hours spent manually gathering and formatting data each week
- Inconsistent communication: Different formats confused internal and external stakeholders
- No accountability framework: KPI deviations lacked assigned owners and follow-up actions
- Limited visibility: Stakeholders couldn't quickly identify performance issues
  
**The goal:** Create a streamlined, standardised reporting system that would enable data-driven decision-making and establish clear accountability for performance improvements.

## Solution Overview

I developed an end-to-end KPI intelligence system that transformed raw operational data into actionable business insights:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Data Extraction** | Automated retrieval from SAP and Navis systems into Excel |
| **Performance Visualisation** | Traffic light dashboard (Red/Orange/Green) for intuitive KPI tracking |
| **Stakeholder Reporting** | Standardised PowerPoint template with embedded charts |
| **Action Framework** | Owner assignment and timeline tracking for KPI deviations |

## Features

### 1. Automated KPI Dashboard (Excel)
- Dynamic data integration from SAP and Navis system exports
- **Traffic light visualisation:**
  - 🔴 **Red:** Below target → Immediate action required
  - 🟠 **Orange:** Near target → Monitoring initiated
  - 🟢 **Green:** Meeting/exceeding target → Best practice documentation
- PivotTables for multi-dimensional analysis (by terminal, shift, equipment type)
- Historical trend tracking for year-over-year comparison

### 2. Standardised Reporting Package (PowerPoint)
- Template with pre-formatted KPI slides
- Embedded live charts linked to Excel data
- Executive summary section for quick stakeholder updates
- External partner version with simplified language

### 3. Action Accountability Framework
- KPI deviation log with root cause analysis
- Assigned owners for each action item
- Timeline tracking and status updates
- Weekly review process integrated into stakeholder meetings

## Business Impact

The KPI Intelligence Dashboard delivered measurable improvements:

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Reporting Preparation Time** | 4-5 hours weekly | <2 hours weekly |
| **Data Accuracy** | Manual errors common | Consistent, validated data |
| **Action Completion Rate** | No tracking system | 85% of actions completed on schedule |
| **Stakeholder Communication** | Ad-hoc, inconsistent | Standardised weekly reports |
| **Decision-Making** | Reactive | Data-driven, proactive |

**Key Achievement:** Enabled data-driven decision-making for internal managers and external partners (truck owners), establishing a culture of accountability and continuous improvement.
